**A decentralized social network that makes the open web fun again.**

Polis helps you publish, follow, and have conversations — without losing control over your content. Your posts are signed markdown files. Your identity is a keypair. Easily deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host and own everything you create.

---

## Why Polis

- **Your content can't be deplatformed.** Posts are markdown files signed with your Ed25519 key, hosted on your domain. No API to shut off, no account to suspend.

- **Comments without spam.** Anyone can comment on your posts (published on *their* domain). You bless the ones you want your audience to see. Unblessed comments still exist — just not on your site.

- **Move hosts anytime.** Everything is flat files. Switch from GitHub Pages to Netlify to a VPS — your content, keys, and followers come with you.

- **No algorithms, no fees, no lock-in.** No engagement metrics, no 10% platform cut, no terms of service that change under your feet.

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vdibart/polis-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

mkdir my-site && cd my-site
polis init
export POLIS_BASE_URL="https://yourdomain.com"

## Two ways to use it

**Command line** — `polis post`, `polis follow`, `polis discover`, `polis comment`, and 23 more commands. All support `--json` for scripting and automation. See the [full command reference](docs/USAGE.md).

**Web UI** — Run `polis-full serve` to get a full publishing environment in your browser — write and preview posts, manage blessings, and discover what authors you follow are writing.

---

## The blessing model

Polis replaces top-down moderation with author-controlled curation.

1. Someone comments on your post (the comment lives on *their* domain)
2. They request your blessing via the discovery service
3. You review and grant or deny — blessed comments appear on your rendered post
4. Unblessed comments still exist on the commenter's domain, just not amplified to your audience

Curated conversation without censorship.

## Going deeper

- **Themes** — Three built-in themes (sols, turbo, zane) with Mustache-style templating. See [TEMPLATING.md](docs/TEMPLATING.md).
- **JSON mode** — Every command supports `--json` for scripting and automation. See [JSON-MODE.md](docs/JSON-MODE.md).
- **Interactive tutorial** — Run `polis-tutorial` for a guided walkthrough with simulated commands.
- **AI integration** — Polis includes a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) skill for natural language workflows: "publish my draft", "check my blessing requests", "comment on Alice's post".

## The bash CLI as specification

The bootstrap bash implementation (`cli-bash/polis`) is a single ~9000-line file that implements the complete Polis protocol with minimal dependencies (bash, jq, curl, ssh). It serves as a readable, executable specification — purpose-built for developers and LLMs to reference when porting Polis to other languages. Not deprecated, not legacy: a spec you can run.
