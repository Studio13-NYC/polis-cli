## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Verify downloads**: Always verify the SHA256 checksum after downloading
   ```bash
   cd cli-bash
   sha256sum -c polis.sha256
   ```

2. **Protect your keys**: Your Ed25519 private key in `.polis/keys/` should never be shared

3. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS URLs for your `POLIS_BASE_URL`

4. **Review before blessing**: Always preview comments before blessing them
   ```bash
   polis preview <comment-url>
   ```
