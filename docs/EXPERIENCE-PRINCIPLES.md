# Polis: Experience Principles

This document defines the spectrum of user experiences Polis will support, from hardcore developers to casual social users. The core principle: **users can move seamlessly between any level** because the underlying primitives are identical at every layer.

---

## The Core Promise

Users own their content. This isn't a feature—it's the foundation everything is built on.

A casual user who signs up through a hosting provider with a username and password owns their content in exactly the same way a developer running their own infrastructure does. The underlying format is identical: markdown files, cryptographic signatures, exportable keys.

Moving "up" toward convenience or "down" toward control requires no data migration, no format conversion, no special tools. Export produces the same output at every level. A Level 7 casual user's export is byte-for-byte compatible with a Level 1 hacker's local setup.

---

## Who This Is For

**Primary audience:** People who want conversation, not just consumption:
- Understand platform limitations (algorithmic manipulation, lock-in, extraction)
- Remember when RSS and blogs worked well
- Value ownership and control over convenience
- See AI as a tool, not a replacement for human agency

**Specific personas and where they land:**

| Persona | Pain Point | Likely Level |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Substack authors** | Paying 10%, fighting comment spam, worried about platform dependency | Level 5-6 |
| **Personal bloggers** | Want discovery without algorithms, community without platforms | Level 2-4 |
| **Ex-platform users** | Left Twitter/LinkedIn/etc. but miss the social layer | Level 6 |
| **Builders** | Want to create clients, tools, services on open protocols | Level 1-2 |

**Not for:** People happy with platforms, those seeking viral growth, anyone prioritizing convenience over ownership.

## The Seven Levels

### Level 1: Builder

*"I could build this myself"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Developers, hobbyist hackers, people who read RFCs for fun |
| **Experience** | Raw CLI, manual everything, probably forks the repo |
| **Key** | Local, self-managed, probably generated via GPG/openssl |
| **Content** | Local markdown files, git repo they control |
| **Hosting** | Self-managed (own server, own Vercel config, whatever) |
| **Discovery** | Could run their own discovery service if they wanted |
| **What Polis provides** | The spec, the CLI, the reference implementation |

**Movement:** Already at maximum control. Can only move "up" toward convenience.

---

### Level 2: Developer

*"I build things, but I don't need to build this"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Working developers, technical hobbyists, "I have a side project" people |
| **Experience** | CLI for authoring, uses provided deploy templates, reads docs |
| **Key** | Local, self-managed, generated by CLI (`polis init`) |
| **Content** | Local markdown files, pushed to GitHub, deployed via template |
| **Hosting** | Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages via one-click template |
| **Discovery** | Uses shared discovery service |
| **What Polis provides** | CLI + deploy templates + discovery service access |

**Difference from Level 1:** They trust provided templates and discovery service rather than rolling their own. Still full visibility into everything.

**Movement down:** Stop using templates, configure everything manually. Trivial.

**Movement up:** Install desktop app, point it at existing files. Nothing changes except the interface.

---

### Level 3: Power User

*"I can follow technical instructions, but I'm not a developer"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Sysadmins, data scientists, technical writers, DevOps, "I use vim but don't code" |
| **Experience** | Guided installer, step-by-step CLI with prompts, hand-holding docs |
| **Key** | Local, but generated and stored by installer (explains what it is, where it lives) |
| **Content** | Local markdown files in a folder they understand |
| **Hosting** | Installer walks them through Vercel deploy (or similar guided flow) |
| **Discovery** | Shared discovery service (invisible to them) |
| **What Polis provides** | Installer script, guided `polis setup` flow, beginner-friendly docs |

**Difference from Level 2:** They didn't come knowing git and Vercel—the tooling taught them just enough. The CLI holds their hand more.

**Design principle:** The installer should *explain* what it's doing, not hide it. "I'm creating your private key and storing it at ~/.polis/keys/private.pem"—they may not fully understand, but it's transparent, and it builds intuition for moving down later.

**Movement down:** They already have the same files/key as Level 2. Just need to learn more about what's there.

**Movement up:** Desktop app—"open this folder" and they're done.

---

### Level 4: Technical Writer

*"I live in markdown, but terminals are not my home"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Documentation writers, academics, bloggers who use static site generators, "I write in Obsidian/Typora" people |
| **Experience** | Desktop app with nice markdown editor, git/CLI invisible but happening |
| **Key** | Local, managed by desktop app, stored in app data (exportable via settings) |
| **Content** | Local markdown files—the app is just a fancy editor for them |
| **Hosting** | "Publish" button in app handles deploy (wraps `polis post` + git push) |
| **Discovery** | Invisible, handled by app |
| **What Polis provides** | Desktop app (Tauri?) that wraps CLI, provides editing + publishing UI |

**Difference from Level 3:** They never see the terminal. The app *is* their Polis experience. But under the hood, it's literally calling CLI commands and reading/writing the same markdown files.

**Design principle:** The files should be in a normal, browsable folder—not hidden in app data. If they open Finder/Explorer, they see their posts as `.md` files. This is the "aha" moment that makes moving down feel safe.

**Movement down:** Open terminal, `polis status` works. Their files are right there. They just learned they had CLI powers all along.

**Movement up:** Desktop app connects to web sync service, files start living in the cloud (but still exportable).

### Level 5: Blogger

*"I want a writing platform, not a tool chain"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Substack/Medium/WordPress refugees, newsletter writers, "I have opinions and an audience" |
| **Experience** | Web-based editor, feels like a blogging platform, no local software |
| **Key** | Local to browser (stored in IndexedDB or similar), or beginning of optional custody |
| **Content** | Stored remotely as markdown files (not a proprietary database) |
| **Hosting** | Self-hosted web app, or managed hosting beginning here |
| **Discovery** | Invisible |
| **What Polis provides** | Web app (self-hostable or hosted), authentication layer, managed storage |

**Storage model:** Managed storage that's literally just a folder of markdown files per user. "We're just holding your folder."

**Design principle:** Signing could still happen client-side (key in browser, never sent to server). This is a meaningful security property even at this convenience level.

**Movement down:** "Export to desktop app"—downloads files + key, opens in Level 4 app.

**Movement up:** "Let us manage your hosting"—files move to fully managed storage, key optionally custodied.

---

### Level 6: Social Native (Burned Before)

*"I want Twitter, but I want to know I can never be kicked off"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Creators who lost accounts, people who've been deplatformed, anyone who's had content disappear, "I don't trust these companies anymore" |
| **Experience** | Mobile-first, social, feels like the platforms they know—but with a visible safety net |
| **Key** | Custodied (encrypted with their password, we hold the blob, never the plaintext) |
| **Content** | Managed storage—their folder of files, handled invisibly |
| **Hosting** | Fully managed |
| **What Polis provides** | The full social experience + **visible, reassuring proof of ownership** |

**The key insight:** The export capability isn't a feature they'll use—it's a feature they need to *see*. A "Your Data" dashboard:
- "You own 847 posts and 2,341 comments"
- "Your signing key (encrypted, only you can unlock)"
- Big green button: "Download Everything"
- Maybe even: "Last verified: 2 minutes ago"—proof it's real, not a fake promise

They may never click that button. But its existence is why they chose Polis.

**Movement down:** They probably won't. But they sleep better knowing they could.

---

### Level 7: Casual

*"I just want to post stuff with my friends"*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Who** | Your aunt, your college roommate, "I don't know what a browser is vs the internet" |
| **Experience** | Username, password, post. Feels like any other app. Zero friction onboarding. |
| **Key** | Fully custodied, generated transparently at signup, encrypted with password |
| **Content** | Managed storage, completely invisible |
| **Hosting** | Fully managed |
| **What Polis provides** | Complete turnkey experience, indistinguishable from centralized platforms |

**The crucial difference from Level 6:** They don't know why this matters. They didn't come because they were burned—they came because a friend invited them or the content was good.

**But the promise still applies.** Their data is still markdown files. Their key is still their key. If someday they *do* get burned—or Polis disappears, or they get curious—the export button works exactly the same.

**Design principle:** Don't bury the ownership message, but don't lead with it either:
- Onboarding: "Your posts are yours forever. [Learn more]"—one line, skippable
- Settings: "Your Data" section exists, clearly labeled, but not in their face
- If something goes wrong: "Don't worry—here's how to take your content with you"

**Movement down:** Probably won't, but some will get curious. The on-ramp to Level 6 ("what does this key thing mean?") should exist for the curious.

## Summary

| Level | Archetype | Key Location | Content Location | What Polis Provides |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Builder** | Local, self-managed | Local, self-hosted | Spec + CLI + reference impl |
| 2 | **Developer** | Local | Local + deploy templates | CLI + templates + discovery |
| 3 | **Power User** | Local (guided) | Local (guided) | Installer + guided setup |
| 4 | **Technical Writer** | Local (in app) | Local (visible folder) | Desktop app wrapping CLI |
| 5 | **Blogger** | Browser/local | Managed (markdown files) | Web app + storage backend |
| 6 | **Burned Before** | Custodied (encrypted) | Managed | Full social + visible safety net |
| 7 | **Casual** | Custodied (encrypted) | Managed | Turnkey, indistinguishable from Twitter |

## Architectural Invariants

These must be true at *every* level for the promise to hold:

1. **Content is always markdown files** — never a proprietary format or database schema
2. **Signatures are always the same format** — generated the same way, verifiable the same way
3. **Keys are always exportable** — even custodied keys can be downloaded or content resigned
4. **Export produces identical output** — a Level 7 export is byte-for-byte usable at Level 1
5. **CLI is always the foundation** — every layer above is calling it (or reimplementing its logic faithfully)

---

## Transition Points

Where the major architectural work lives:

| Transition | Work Required |
|------------|---------------|
| **L3 → L4** | Desktop app that wraps CLI (Tauri?) |
| **L4 → L5** | Web app + managed storage that preserves file-based model |
| **L5 → L6** | Client-side key encryption, custody model, "Your Data" dashboard |
| **L6 → L7** | Frictionless onboarding flow that hides complexity without breaking promises |
