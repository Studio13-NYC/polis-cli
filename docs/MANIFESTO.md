# Polis - Manifesto

## Summary

**"AI can lead us back to the open web we lost instead of down another rabbit hole. Your content, your control, no walled gardens."**

## Full Pitch

### Remember the Open Web?

Before Twitter became a fiefdom. Before LinkedIn owned your professional network. Before Substack took 10% and controlled your subscriber list. There was a time when you published to *your* domain, people subscribed via RSS, and tools like Google Reader made discovery joyful.

**We can have that again—but better.**

### What We Lost, and How We Get It Back

The internet funneled us into walled gardens because decentralization was too hard. Manual discovery, keyword search, fragmented tools—platforms won by making things *easy*, then locked us in.

**AI changes the equation.** The same technology platforms are using to extract more value out of us can instead make the web more accessible *and* more open.

### Introducing Polis

Polis is federated social networking for the AI era:

**Think:** Blogs + RSS, orchestrated by AI, delivered to you naturally

- **Your content, your domain** - Publish markdown to any static host (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, your own server).  You retain control over everything you write, even comments.
- **Networks of trust** - No platform algorithm pushing you into echo chambers.  Follow your own path.
- **Standards-based** - Just HTTPS, DNS, and Ed25519 signatures. No blockchain, no tokens, no passkeys, no spyware posing as social content, no proprietary protocols
- **File-based & portable** - self-contained, versioned, and cryptographically signed.  Move anywhere anytime
- **AI as partner and guide** - AI handles discovery and navigation complexity. Bring your AI (Claude, ChatGPT, local models) or use none. No AI lock-in.

### Why This Works Now

**AI makes decentralization viable.** It handles the hard parts (discovery, navigation, curation) while you keep ownership. This isn't using AI to filter platform garbage—it's building something better from the ground up where AI is your tool, not your controller.

**Restoration, not nostalgia.** We're using the most powerful new technology to fix what broke when platforms hijacked the open web. Discovery instead of consumption. Ownership instead of extraction.

### Who This Is For

Not fighting Twitter's network effects—serving the people platforms are losing.

**For people who want conversation, not just consumption.**

- Substack authors tired of comment moderation nightmares and platform fees
- Bloggers who remember Google Reader and want that feeling back
- Anyone who values **ownership over convenience**, **discovery over feeds**, **quality over engagement metrics**

## Key Talking Points

### Technical Advantages
- **Self-contained**: Everything is files. Markdown + frontmatter, version controlled with git
- **Portable**: No lock-in. Move hosts, change tools, fork the format—you own it all
- **Secure**: Ed25519 signatures, SHA-256 content addressing, cryptographic verification
- **Simple stack**: Static files on HTTPS. Works with any host, no special infrastructure needed

### The AI-Forward Difference
- **Back to the open web, not down rabbit holes**: Today's platforms use AI to trap your attention. Polis uses AI to guide you back to the open web—helping you explore, not consume
- **AI as orchestrator, not product**: Handles discovery, navigation, curation—the complex parts
- **No AI lock-in**: Structured data (markdown + metadata) is AI-agnostic. Choose your AI like you choose your browser
- **Built for emergent features**: Rich metadata lets AI compose new capabilities without protocol changes
- **Offensive strategy**: Don't filter platform feeds with AI—build something better where AI serves *you*

### The Blessing Model
- Anyone can respond to your posts (they publish on *their* domain)
- You curate which comments get *amplified* to your audience
- **Blessed**: High visibility (your audience + theirs)
- **Unblessed**: Still exists, just not amplified by the post's author
- **Result**: Anti-spam without censorship. Quality curation without platform power.

## Target Audience (Detailed)

**Primary**: Technically-savvy people who want conversation, not just consumption:
- Understand platform limitations (algorithmic manipulation, lock-in, extraction)
- Remember when RSS and blogs worked well
- Value ownership and control over convenience
- See AI as a tool, not a replacement for human agency

**Secondary**: Builders who want to create on open protocols:
- Want simple, extensible technologies to build on
- Value global scalability without platform lock-in

**Specific personas**:
- **Substack authors**: Paying 10%, fighting comment spam, worried about platform dependency
- **Personal bloggers**: Want discovery without algorithms, community without platforms
- **Ex-platform users**: Left Twitter/LinkedIn/etc. but miss the social layer
- **Builders**: Want to create clients, tools, services on open protocols

**Not for**: People happy with platforms, those seeking viral growth, anyone prioritizing convenience over ownership.
