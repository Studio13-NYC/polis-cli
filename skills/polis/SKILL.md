# Polis Skill

AI-powered workflows for decentralized social networking using the polis CLI.

## Core Principles

1. **Always use `--json` flag** for structured output parsing
2. **Handle errors gracefully** using structured error codes
3. **Confirm destructive actions** before execution
4. **Preserve user content** - never overwrite without confirmation
5. **Leave git control with user** - offer commits, don't auto-commit

## CLI Location

The polis CLI is located at: `./cli-bash/polis`

All commands should use the `--json` flag for machine-readable output:
```bash
./cli-bash/polis --json <command> [options]
```

## Environment Requirements

The following environment variables should be configured:
- `POLIS_BASE_URL` - Your polis site URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
- `DISCOVERY_SERVICE_URL` - Discovery service URL
- `DISCOVERY_SERVICE_KEY` - API authentication key

---

## Feature 1: Publish

**Trigger phrases**: "publish", "post", "sign and publish", "deploy post"

### Workflow

1. **Read the draft file** to understand content and extract title

2. **Suggest/refine title** if needed:
   - Review the markdown heading
   - Suggest improvements if title could be clearer or more engaging
   - Let user approve or modify

3. **Check for existing frontmatter**:
   - If file has polis frontmatter (already published): note to user, use `republish`
   - If no frontmatter: use `post`

4. **Execute the command**:
   ```bash
   # For new posts
   ./cli-bash/polis --json post <file>

   # For updates to existing posts
   ./cli-bash/polis --json republish <file>

   # For inline content (stdin)
   echo "<content>" | ./cli-bash/polis --json post - --filename <name.md> --title "<title>"
   ```

5. **Parse and report results**:
   - File path (canonical location)
   - Content hash
   - Canonical URL
   - Signature confirmation

6. **Offer git commit** (don't auto-commit):
   - Show what would be committed
   - Ask user if they want to commit
   - If yes, stage and commit with descriptive message

### Notes
- Accept drafts from any path (no restriction to specific folders)
- Support stdin for inline content creation

---

## Feature 2: Discover

**Trigger phrases**: "discover", "find posts about", "search for", "what's being discussed"

### Workflow

1. **Load following list**:
   ```bash
   cat metadata/following.json
   ```

2. **Fetch local index** (your own content):
   ```bash
   ./cli-bash/polis --json index
   ```

3. **Fetch followed authors' indexes**:
   For each author in following.json:
   ```bash
   curl -s <author-url>/metadata/public.jsonl
   ```
   - Parse and aggregate posts/comments
   - Handle unreachable sites gracefully (skip with note)

4. **Semantic matching**:
   - Match the topic/query against titles and excerpts
   - Consider both your content and followed authors' content
   - Rank by relevance

5. **Present results**:
   - Show matching posts with: author, title, URL, brief excerpt
   - Group by author or relevance as appropriate

6. **Offer next actions**:
   - "Preview this post?" -> use preview command
   - "Comment on this?" -> switch to comment workflow

### Technical Notes
- Following list format: `metadata/following.json` contains author URLs
- Each author's public index at: `<author-base-url>/metadata/public.jsonl`
- This is following-based discovery (your network only)

---

## Feature 3: Comment

**Trigger phrases**: "comment on", "reply to", "respond to"

### Workflow

1. **Preview the target post/comment**:
   ```bash
   ./cli-bash/polis --json preview <url>
   ```

2. **Present content to user**:
   - Show title, author, content body
   - Show signature verification status
   - Summarize the key points

3. **Gather context for drafting**:
   - Read user's previous comments from local index to learn their tone/style
   - If enough prior comments exist: draft a reply matching their voice
   - If not enough context: ask user what they want to say

4. **Present draft inline** for user to edit:
   - Show the suggested draft
   - Let user modify directly before proceeding

5. **Create the comment**:
   ```bash
   echo "<approved-content>" | ./cli-bash/polis --json comment - <url> --filename <reply-name.md>
   ```

6. **Report beseech status**:
   - CLI automatically sends blessing request
   - Report the pending status to user

### Tone Matching
- Read user's previous comments to learn their voice
- Match that tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.)
- Fall back to neutral professional if no prior comments exist

---

## Feature 4: Manage Blessings

**Trigger phrases**: "manage blessings", "review blessings", "blessing requests", "pending comments"

### Workflow

1. **Sync and fetch requests**:
   ```bash
   ./cli-bash/polis --json blessing sync
   ./cli-bash/polis --json blessing requests
   ```

2. **Report auto-blessed comments** (FYI):
   - Note any comments that were auto-blessed from followed authors
   - These don't need review, just confirmation they were handled

3. **Walk through pending requests one-at-a-time**:

   For each pending request:

   a. **Preview the comment**:
      ```bash
      ./cli-bash/polis --json preview <comment_url>
      ```

   b. **Assess quality** using these signals (weighted):
      1. **Signature validity** (required) - invalid = recommend deny
      2. **Thread-specific trust** (high weight) - has this author been blessed on other posts?
      3. **On-topic relevance** - is it about the post?
      4. **Constructiveness** - thoughtful vs spam/trolling
      5. **Network reputation** (lower weight) - followed by people you follow?

   c. **Present with recommendation**:
      ```
      Request <hash> from <author>
      On: <post-url>
      Comment: "<excerpt>..."
      Signature: VALID/INVALID

      AI Recommendation: GRANT/DENY (reasoning)

      [Grant] [Deny] [Skip]
      ```

   d. **Execute user's decision**:
      ```bash
      ./cli-bash/polis --json blessing grant <hash>
      # or
      ./cli-bash/polis --json blessing deny <hash>
      ```

   e. **Move to next request**

4. **Deny silently** (no rationale sent to commenter - future feature)

---

## Feature 5: Status

**Trigger phrases**: "status", "polis status", "what's my status", "show activity"

### Workflow

1. **Gather data**:
   ```bash
   # Your published content
   ./cli-bash/polis --json index

   # Pending blessing requests (others wanting your blessing)
   ./cli-bash/polis --json blessing requests

   # Git status for uncommitted changes
   git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null || true

   # Discovery service health
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "${DISCOVERY_SERVICE_URL}/health" 2>/dev/null || echo "unreachable"

   # Following count
   cat metadata/following.json | jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0"
   ```

2. **Parse and present dashboard**:
   ```
   === Polis Status ===

   Published Content:
   - X posts (latest: "<title>" - <relative-time>)
   - Y comments (latest: reply to <domain> - <relative-time>)

   Pending Actions:
   - N blessing requests awaiting YOUR review
   - M of YOUR comments awaiting blessing from others
   - P uncommitted files

   Network:
   - Following: Q authors
   - Discovery service: connected/disconnected
   ```

### Dashboard Includes
- Post/comment counts with latest activity
- Pending blessing requests (others -> you)
- Pending beseech status (your comments -> others)
- Uncommitted git changes
- Following count
- Discovery service health check

## Feature 6: Notifications

**Trigger phrases**: "notifications", "pending actions", "what needs attention", "any updates", "check for updates"

### Workflow

1. **Fetch notifications**:
   ```bash
   # List unread notifications
   ./cli-bash/polis --json notifications

   # List all notifications (including read)
   ./cli-bash/polis --json notifications list --all

   # Filter by type
   ./cli-bash/polis --json notifications list --type version_available,new_follower
   ```

2. **Present categorized notifications**:
   ```
   === Notifications ===

   Updates (1 unread):
   - [version_available] CLI v0.35.0 available (you have v0.34.0)

   Pending Actions (2 unread):
   - [version_pending] Metadata files need update - run 'polis rebuild'

   Social (3 unread):
   - [new_follower] alice.com started following you
   - [new_post] bob.com published "New Article"
   - [blessing_changed] Your comment was blessed on charlie.com
   ```

3. **Offer actions based on notification type**:
   - `version_available` - "Upgrade available. Show release notes?"
   - `version_pending` - "Run `polis rebuild --all` to update metadata?"
   - `new_follower` - "Follow them back?"
   - `new_post` - "Preview this post?"
   - `blessing_changed` - "View the comment?"

4. **Mark notifications as handled**:
   ```bash
   # Mark specific notification as read
   ./cli-bash/polis --json notifications read <id>

   # Mark all as read
   ./cli-bash/polis --json notifications read --all

   # Dismiss old notifications
   ./cli-bash/polis --json notifications dismiss --older-than 30d
   ```

### Notification Types

| Type | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `version_available` | Discovery service | New CLI version released |
| `version_pending` | Local detection | CLI upgraded but metadata needs rebuild |
| `new_follower` | Discovery service | Someone followed you |
| `new_post` | Discovery service | Followed author published |
| `blessing_changed` | Discovery service | Your comment was blessed/unblessed |

### Syncing Notifications

```bash
# Fetch new notifications from discovery service
./cli-bash/polis --json notifications sync

# Reset and do full re-sync
./cli-bash/polis --json notifications sync --reset
```

### Configuring Preferences

```bash
# Show current config
./cli-bash/polis --json notifications config

# Set poll interval
./cli-bash/polis notifications config --poll-interval 30m

## Feature 7: Site Registration

**Trigger phrases**: "register", "register site", "make discoverable", "unregister"

### Workflow

1. **Register with discovery service**:
   ```bash
   ./cli-bash/polis --json register
   ```

2. **Report registration status**:
   - Site URL registered
   - Public key stored
   - Now discoverable by other polis users

3. **Unregister if requested** (destructive - confirm first):
   ```bash
   ./cli-bash/polis --json unregister --force
   ```

### Notes
- Registration makes your site discoverable
- Required for receiving blessing requests
- `polis init --register` can auto-register during initialization

## Feature 8: Clone Remote Site

**Trigger phrases**: "clone", "download site", "fetch site", "mirror"

### Workflow

1. **Clone a remote polis site**:
   ```bash
   # Clone to auto-named directory
   ./cli-bash/polis --json clone https://alice.com

   # Clone to specific directory
   ./cli-bash/polis --json clone https://alice.com ./alice-site

   # Force full re-download
   ./cli-bash/polis --json clone https://alice.com --full

   # Only fetch changes (incremental)
   ./cli-bash/polis --json clone https://alice.com --diff
   ```

2. **Report what was downloaded**:
   - Posts fetched
   - Comments fetched
   - Metadata files

### Use Cases
- Local backup of followed authors
- Offline reading
- Analysis of site structure

---

## Feature 9: About / Site Info

**Trigger phrases**: "about", "site info", "show config", "what's my setup"

### Workflow

1. **Get comprehensive site info**:
   ```bash
   ./cli-bash/polis --json about
   ```

2. **Present dashboard**:
   ```
   === Site ===
   URL: https://yoursite.com
   Title: Your Site Name

   === Versions ===
   CLI: 0.34.0
   Manifest: 0.34.0

   === Keys ===
   Status: configured
   Fingerprint: SHA256:abc123...

   === Discovery ===
   Service: https://discovery.polis.pub
   Registered: yes
   ```

### Notes
- Replaces the old `polis config` command
- Shows version mismatch warnings (CLI vs manifest)

## Error Handling

When commands fail, parse the JSON error response:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "command": "...",
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable message"
  }
}
```

Common error codes and responses:
- `FILE_NOT_FOUND` - Help user locate the correct file
- `INVALID_INPUT` - Explain required format
- `API_ERROR` - Check network/discovery service status
- `SIGNATURE_ERROR` - Report verification failure
- `INVALID_STATE` - Guide user (e.g., run `polis init` first)
